Staley et al looked at the microbial community throughout the Mississippi river, sampling a variety of locations that differed by nearby land use. Specifically they looked at both taxonomic diversity and functional diversity of bacteria, asking if these two types of diversity were related. Another core component of the study was to compare two different methodologies - metagenomic sequencing and functional-inference based (PICRUSt) approaches.

Results generally varied based on methodology, however both metagenomic sequencing and functional-inference based (PICRUSt) found highest functional abundance of 'metabolism'. Lower taxonomic diversity was found at the more urban sites. The PICRUSt approach found more significant correlations between taxanomic diversity and functional diversity. Neither approach found much functional variation between sampling sites.  

Comparing these two different approaches is important for future studies weighing cost vs accuracy when sampling microbial communities. Additionally, it is important to understand how microbial functional traits may be affected by land
