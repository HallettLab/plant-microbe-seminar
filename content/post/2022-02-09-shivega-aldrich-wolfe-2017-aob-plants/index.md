**Native plants fare better against an introdued competitor with native microbes and lower nitrogen availability**  
Shivega, W.G. & Aldrich-Wolfe, L. (2017). https://doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plx004  

**Purpose of study:** It is poorly understood the ways in which soil microbial communities may mediate competitive interactions between conspecific and heterospecific plants. This is espeically important when considering competition between native and introduced invasive plant species. Here, Shivega & Aldrich-Wolfe conducted a greenhouse experiment whereby two native plants (*Oligoneuron rigidum* and *Andropogon gerardii*) were grown in treatments of intra- and interspecific competition with an exotic species (*Carduus acanthoides*), low and high N availability, and sterile soil or soil with native microbes intact.  

**Conclusions and implications**: The authors found that treatments with native soil microbial communities rendered higher biomass for the native plant species grown in intra- and interspecific competition. Additionally, treatments with higher soil nitrogen availability were more beneficial for the exotic species than the natives. Ultimately, lower N availability and soil with native microbes resulted in the most positive competitive outcomes among the native plants. These results demonstrate that the resilience of native plant species to invasions can be facilitated by the symbiotic interactions with their native soil microbes, and that anthropogenic disturbances like nitrogen deposition can exacerbate plant invasions.
