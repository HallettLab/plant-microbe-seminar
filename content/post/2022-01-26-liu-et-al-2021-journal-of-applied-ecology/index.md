**Long-term heavy grazing increases community-level foliar fungal diseases by shifting plant composition**

**Objective:** Explore the direct and indirect effects of grazing intensity on foliar fungal diseases at plant population and community levels.

**What they did:** The authors sampled vegetation characteristics and foliar fungal diseases in a grazing intensity experiment in a semi-arid grassland in China with four grazing intensities. Sheep happily grazed the plants for 13 years (ample time for them to have affected the plant community & associated foliar fungal diseases), after which the researchers sampled plant cover, abundance, and species richness and quantified all foliar fungal diseases present in plots. From there, they calculated the community pathogen load and disease proneness. They used a structural equation model to investigate the effects of grazing on pathogen load - both directly and as mediated through species richness, the community disease proneness, and leaf phosphorus concentration.

**What they found:** At the population and community levels, the response of fungal diseases to grazing intensity differed by disease type: the severity and pathogen load of five rusts and five powdery mildews decreased with grazing intensity, while the severity and pathogen load of two leaf spots increased with grazing intensity. However, overall, heavy grazing increased community pathogen load. 

Grazing indirectly increased pathogen load of leaf spots by increasing disease proneness, which outweighed the direct effect of grazing on pathogen load.

**Why this is important** This provides evidence that long-term heavy grazing can indirectly increase community pathogen loads through changes in plant community composition. This has important management implications- maintaining light to moderate grazing activity or leaving grasslands ungrazed for a period of time may help control foliar fungal diseases. We also need to consider infectious diseases when predicting the response of grassland ecosystems to anthropogenic activities.
