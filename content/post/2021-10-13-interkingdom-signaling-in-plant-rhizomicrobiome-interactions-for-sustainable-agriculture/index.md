## Interkingdom signaling in plant-rhizomicrobiome interactions for sustainable agriculture

### Why is it important
Communication between plants and their soil microbiome in the rhizosphere is mediated through complex signal molecules that are secreted during beneficial and harmful interactions. Likewise, intra- and inter-species communication occurs between microbes themselves and influences microorganism behavior within communities. Additionally, the structural and physical heterogeneity of soil is affected by molecules that are released in these root exudates. As such, interpreting this chemical signaling and investigating the mechanisms involved are encouraging avenues for increasing sustainable agriculture production and elucidating further plant-microbe interactions.

### What they did
In this paper, Phour et al. describes how the rhizo-microbiome is shaped in response to released root exudates. Furthermore, they demonstrate how microbiome structure can be predicted and controlled, as part of its function in the rhizosphere through different secreted compounds â€“ with the hope that it would lead to better applications of beneficial plant-microbe interactions. They discuss the recent progress in understanding inter-kingdom communication and the interactions between plants and microbes. Specifically, they look at interactions that influence plant growth, gene expression, nutrient uptake and resistance to pests and diseases. Likewise, Phour et al. suggests that there they may be novel applications for the mitigation of abiotic stresses in plants which could help improve ecosystem productivity for sustainable agriculture.
### What they found
Quorum signaling, has been shown in studies over the last decade to be a complex regulatory mechanism for gene expression among inter- and intra-species. Likewise plant growth promoting bacterial genera including rhizo-microbe symbionts and free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria have been studied intensively, in which quorum signaling is involved in the regulation of specific gene expressions. This signaling cascade is not only important for bacterial communication, but also plays a key role in plant-microbe interactions. Moreover, the ability of plants to somewhat control the establishment of rhizo-microbiomes for their own benefits had been recently established and has direct implications for modern horticultural practices. As such, it is imperative to better understand the inter- and intra-communication between the rhizo-microbiome and plants in this regard.
