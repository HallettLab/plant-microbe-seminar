# What they did and found
This was a perspective paper on how the functional trait approach can be applied in ecosystem models to predict the ecosystem implications of microbial processes under altered environmental conditions. 
* Microbes may invest more their energy into maintenance activities relative to growth in resource limited or stressed abiotic conditions like extreme moisture, temp, pH and salinity. This may have consequences to soil carbon cycling.
* They adopted Grime's competitor-stress tolerator-ruderal (C-S-R) framework to microbes. They looked at tradeoffs among microbial traits linked to growth yield, resource acquisition, and stress tolerance and their consequences to carbon fluxes.

# Importance
*This paper proposes a trait-based modelling framework based on microbial life strategies that holds promise for representing microbial characteristics in simulations of system-level processes at various spatial scales.
*An advantage of using the trait-based approach is that explicit microbial representation is not necessary, but rather the aggregate microbial community composition and physiology and their response to changes in environmental conditions could be used to model ecosystem functions.
