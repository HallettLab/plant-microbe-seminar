# Belowground mechanisms for oak regeneration: Interactions among fire, soil microbes, and plant community alter oak seedling growth

*By Kendall K.Beals, Alex E.Scearce, Alex T.Swystun, Jennifer A.Schweitzer*

## What they did
The authors grew oak (*Quercus velutina*) seedlings with and without pine (*Pinus taeda*) seedlings in soil that was either burned or unburned. They characterized the microbial community in both soil types and monitored plant growth. 

## What they found
Burned soil had fewer plant pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi. Oak seedlings did better with fewer pathogenic fungi and had the greatest root biomass when grown with pine seedlings in burned soil.

## Why it matters
We need to know more about how plants and microbes respond to fire to better manage post-fire landscapes. Previously, it was thought that these oak do well after fire because they had less interspecific competition, but these results indicate the story is more complicated.
