## Purpose of Study 
Researchers investigated bacterial microbiota in the seed, root endosphere and rhizoshpere in Oryza sativa (rice) to better understand vertical vs horizontal transmission of these communities. 

## Study Conclusions and Implications
Plant microhabitat was a large driver in shaping plant-associated bacterial microbiota, where seed, endosphere and rhizosphere microhabitats possessed ditinct core generalist species. These core species exert important functions on plant health.


## Future Directions
- Use of gnotobiotic approaches to better understand the impact of these important microorganisms.
