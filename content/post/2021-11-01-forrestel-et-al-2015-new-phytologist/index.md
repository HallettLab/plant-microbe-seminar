What they did:
 	This experiment examined ontogenetic trait differences in the genus Lasthenia in response to environmental hydrology. They compared leaf morphology, aerenchyma, stomatal characteristics, and heterophylly of 5 species in vernal pools and terrestrial environments. They found that juveniles showed greater variety in leaf morphology and aerenchyma proportions, but the trait differences converged as the plants aged. 

Importance:
	I think it's an interesting study on ontogenetic trait shifts depending on environmental conditions (especially as habitat conditions might change in the future). With the exception of stomatal density and length, most traits reacted as they predicted. I was surprised to see that aerenchyma proportions decreased in all species regardless of location—doesn’t seem beneficial.
