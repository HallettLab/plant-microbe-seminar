Background: Many microbes rely on kin (ecotypes) and community members to survive in real life ecosystems. This is due to mutualisms that can help them overcome auxotrophies (inability to produce a necessary nutrient). In bacterioplankton this is a common occurence. This can also explain why many microbes cannot be cultured in a lab with contemporary media / techniques. 

What they did: A time sequence sampling of Lake Erken, Sweden from 2007 - 2015 to survey bacterioplankton and changes in community over time. This was paired with co-culturing experiments and chemical analyses to understand the dynamics of the 3 most common and abundant species in the lake. 

What they found: Bacterioplankton were dependent on one another for their mutual survival and coexistence. In some cases this was dependence on other species - in other cases this was dependence on ecotype differentiation within species. This could be disrupted by inputs (plant and microbial detritus) but would restabilize over time.
