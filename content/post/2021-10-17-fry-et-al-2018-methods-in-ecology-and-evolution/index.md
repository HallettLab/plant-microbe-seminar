**Using plant, microbe, and soil fauna traits to improve the predictive power of biogeochemical models**

https://besjournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.uoregon.edu/doi/epdf/10.1111/2041-210X.13092

What they did:
 
This paper created a framework that integrates plant, microbe, and fauna functional traits in modeling of terrestrial biogeochemical cycling. It proposed three framework levels: explicit, integrated, and implicit. The explicit framework is localized with direct experimental measurements. The integrated framework connects the soil food web and biogeochemical cycling. The implicit framework looks at a global level and associates functional traits to each other in order to predict nutrient cycling. 

Importance:

This paper seeks to better understand interactions between plants, microbes, and fauna. This proposed framework incorporates functional traits to understand nutrient dynamics and ecosystem processes. As far as I know, few studies have also included fauna with plants and microbes in functional trait models.
