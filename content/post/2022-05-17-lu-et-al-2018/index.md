This paper explores the potential of microbes, specifically rhizosphere microbes, in modulating plant phenology and fecundity. Using both a wild type and mutant Arabidopsis the authors grew individuals in sterile conditions and with grassland soils over three generations.  They found different rhizosphere microbes in each generation but only observed a shift in phenology and number of fruit in the third generation for each Arabidopsis. Additionally the shift in rhizosphere microbes but not huge, suggesting that more rare microbes may play a significant role. In the third generation the opposite effect was seen in the wild type vs the mutant, the wild type had delayed phenology with more fruit, the mutant earlier phenology with fewer fruit. Using the microbes from the third generation of Arabidopsis and adding them to the soil with new Arabidopsis individuals, the authors were able to confirm that the shift in microbes lead to the shift in phenology and fitness. The authors showed that this shift was due to microbe mediated changes in N availability and the amount of the phytohormone indole acetic acid (IAA). 
I thought this paper was interesting because it adds yet another factor to the multitude of known controls on plant phenology. I liked that the specific mechanisms were explored and Iâ€™m interested to try and think more about how this may apply and vary with different species in a natural setting.
