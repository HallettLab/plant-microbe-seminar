A Path Forward: Promoting Microbial-Based Methods in the Control of Invasive Plant Species  
Maryam Shahrtash and Shawn Brown  
University of Memphis Department of Biology, Memphis, TN, USA  
Plants 2021

Who they are  
The first author is a PhD student in Dr. Brown's lab at UM. She is originally from Iran where she completed her bachelor's and master's degrees at Shiraz University.

What they did  
They reviewed the current knowledge and future applications of incorporating plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions into invasive plant management strategies.

What they found  
To control invasive plants, several types of interactions are addressed, including introducing beneficial microbes that facilitate pathogens of invasive plants, adding microbes that are antagonists of the microbes that are beneficial to invasive plants, removing pathogen antagonists, or reducing beneficial microbes. 

What it means  
This review provides a good background of known research into incorporating microbes into invasive plant species management plans. They suggest three main research priorities for future directions:  
1. Integrated predictive models to understand multipartite effects of pathogen-endophyte interactions associated with invasive plants  
2. Define and understand core pathogen-endophyte combinations on invasive plants to inform future studies  
3. Developing targeted application plans informed by how microbial communities mechanistically interact with hosts, environment, and management practices
