Assembly of seed-associated microbial communities within and across successive plant generations


What they did  
Estimated seed microbial community for individual plants across three generations by amplifying and sequencing the bacterial GyrB and fungal ITS1 genes. They also estimated the relative contribution of dispersal and ecological drift in between-individual interactions using a neutral community model.  


What they found  
Seed microbe communities show little heritability across the three generations. Fluctuations in seed microbe community structure were due to differences in plant community membership and composition across the three generations, as well as individual level variation in plant hosts. Ecological drift drove changes in seed bacterial community structure, while dispersal was more involved in the assembly of the fungal portion of the seed microbiome. 


Why it matters  
This study begins to reveal the processes that drive community assembly of seed microbe communities.
