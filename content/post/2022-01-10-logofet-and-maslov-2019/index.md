##Importance
This study showed for the first time two species from the Vaccinium genus that coexisted when grown together where the other decreased in a plot by itself. 

##Approach
The researchers used a 25 year long study, where they applied a Markov chain model to their data post-fire to determine if dominant shrub species were competing or coexisting. 

##Conclusions
Their model provided spatial and temporal characteristics of the processes occurring but did not allude to underlying cause and effect mechanisms. However, they argued that this model could be applied to pinpoint areas where this insight would be valuable.
