**Ontogeny strongly and differentially alters leaf economic and other key traiats in three diverse Helianthus species.**

https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert249


**What they did:**

They grew multiple populations of three species of sunflowers under the same controlled environmental conditions.

They asked how leaf economic spectrum (resource conservative vs. acquisitive) related traits change at different developmental stages. 

**Findings:**

Traits did vary over development, but with inconsistent patterns. Some traits (photosynthetic rate, leaf nitrogen, LMA) had huge variation (2/3 of all variability even across species).

**Why it's interesting:**

It's a lot of variation. Species level traits need to incorporate this or state what developmental stage they're talking about. There is mystery to unlock to learn how they change their strategy so dramatically (genetics stuff).
