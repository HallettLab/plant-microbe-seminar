**Trait-environment interactions affect plant establishment success during restoration.**

C.R. Zirbel and L.A. Brudvig 2020. Trait-environment interactions affect plant establishment success during restoration. Ecology 101(3)

**What they did:**

The authors looked at how plant traits interact with environment to affect estabishment in a restoration context. They worked within 12 ongoing restorations at Kellog Biological Station in Michigan.  

They asked whether growth rate, leaf nitrogen, seed mass, root mass fraction and SLA affected various species establishment across variable soil moisture, light availability and herbivore pressure. 

**Findings:**

Their overall model explained 17% of the variation in seedling establishment.  Specific significant interactions included soil moisture and root mass fraction (high root mass fraction did better in high soil moisture and vice versa), leaf nitrogen and herbivore pressure (low leaf nitrogen helped with herbivory), and SLA and light availability (high SLA helped in low light and vice versa). 

**Why it's interesting:**

Looks at functional traits of seedlings, plant traits change over time! Seedling traits and establishment can determine natural distributions (this is a big bottleneck). Direct correlations of traits with establishment doesnt go far enough, you need to contextualize traits in different environmental contexts. Can help with seed selection for successful restoration in different contexts.
