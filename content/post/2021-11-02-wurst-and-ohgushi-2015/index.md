# Do plant- and soil-mediated legacy effects impact future biotic interactions?
*by Susanne Wurst and Takayuki Ohgushi*

### Published 8 April 2015 in **Functional Ecology**
Available open access at [https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12456]

## Purpose of Study 
Authors wanted to understand if biotic interactions (such as herbivory) on plants can have above- and below-ground legacy effects and if these effects persist "long-term"

## Study Conclusions and Implications
They concluded that above- and below-ground interactions have long-term effects on plants and their "zones of influence"  can generate legacy effects that ultimately contribute to ecosystem function.

## Future Directions
-increase above- and below-ground parameters
-consider different temporal scales
-better understanding legacy effects and their mechanisms
-evaluate abiotic influences on above- and below-ground interactions
