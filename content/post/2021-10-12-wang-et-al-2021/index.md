## Why you should read this paper
Plant-fungal carbon and nitrogen economics are complicated. We're not sure what happens when you limit water or add key plant nutrients. Wang et al. tested how these processes change under experimental conditions and found a trade-off between whether plants give carbon to fungi or deposit it in the soil. 

## What they did
The authors applied stable isotope tracers to C4 grasses and tested aboveground, belowground, and microbial biomass for these stable isotopes. They manipulated the plants by applying nitrogen fertilizer, restricting rainfall, or a combination of both nitrogen and experimental drought.

## What they found
Drought reduced carbon deposition and biomass. However, adding nitrogen increased both. Drought decreased microbial biomass but nitrogen addition increased it. Plants had greater root investment with the addition of nitrogen.

## Importance
They concluded that adding nutrients increases plant investment in roots but not rhizodeposition or mycorrhizal symbiosis. They also concluded that mycorrhizae mediate belowground carbon deposition.

## Key figure
![A figure divided into four parts. The first part is the control and shows that 56% of carbon went to roots and 44% to soil. The second part is nitrogen addition and shows that 49% of carbon went to roots and 51% to soil with increased phosphorus limitation and AMF colonization. The third part is drought and shows that 35% of carbon went to roots and 65% to soil with increased rhizodeposition and root depth and decreased specific root length and area. THe fourth part is drought and nitrogen addition and shows that 74% of carbon went to roots and 26% to soil.](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f205cfc1-ff47-486b-80eb-8989e9a554b7/jec13746-fig-0005-m.jpg)
*Figure 5: Carbon (C) allocated to roots and soils in proportion to total below-ground C allocation as affected by drought and nitrogen (N) addition. Drought proportionally increased C deposited into soil but decreased C allocated to roots due to lower C investments on adjusting root traits for nutrient acquisition, showing decreases in specific root length (SRL) and specific root area (SRA) but an increase in root diameter (RD). Nitrogen addition caused a decrease in soil P availability co-occurring with higher colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), potentially suggesting that plants suffered from a P limitation and relied more on AMF for P uptake. Moreover, N addition counteracted drought effects on proportional C allocation between roots and soils, possibly due to plant leveraging more C to extending roots and building root biomass for soil water exploration under N-rich but water-deficit conditions*
