Soil microbes alter competition between native and invasive plants


What they did

The authors evaluated the soil legacy effects of two invasive grasses and simulated drought influenced plant performance and competition between a native pine and invasive grasses in a pine ecosystem. They established a greenhouse experiment to test performance of three species (cogongrass, longleaf pine and wiregrass) in response to soil microbial communities from a previous invasion × drought field experiment. 


What they found

That competition can modify plant–microbe interactions including the direction and magnitude of the effects. Specifically, they found that soil microbes enhanced plant growth for the invasive and decreased for the native species.
When evaluating the effect of soil microbes with plant competition, the microbial communities switched from positive to negative feedback for the invader and from negative to positive for the native species.

Why it matters

Microbial communities can modified competitive outcomes by facilitating a competitive hierarchy. Soil microbes could benefit the invasive plant only in a low competition environment such as during early colonization and benefit pines only under high competition environments. This means that competitive interactions can change over a long timeframe and could have an influence in management decisions for restoration
