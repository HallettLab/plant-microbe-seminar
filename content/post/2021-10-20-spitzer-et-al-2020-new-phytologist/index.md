**Root trait-microbial relationships across tundra plant species**
*Spitzer et al. 2020*
<https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.16982>


 
 

* What they did: 

-They performed a glasshouse study using seeds and field soil collected from a sub-arctic location in Sweden. They then characterized fine root traits (11) for 20 different plant species as well as rhizosphere microbial composition (bacteria and fungi). For microbial traits, they performed PLFA (so much work!) in addition to categorizing sequence data into functional guilds.
 
 
 
 
* What they found: 

-The plant root economic spectrum was used to define plants along a resource acquisition vs conservative resource use and they found associations between broad groups of microbes and where plants fall on the gradient of fine root economics -- specifically, fungal to bacterial ratios correlated with their PLFA data (positively correlated with F:B ratios, negatively with Gram+:Gram-). The parsing of fungal data into functional guilds revealed no relationship between the root economics spectrum and functional guilds, but AM fungi negatively correlated with number of root forks. Other functional guilds of fungi correlated with specific fine root traits such as specific root area and specific root length.

* Why itâ€™s interesting/important: 

-The results of this study shed light on relationships linking rhizosphere microbial composition/functional guilds with plant root traits in the tundra which has implications for C cycling across heterogeneous landscapes under global change. 
Linking broad groupings of plant and microbial taxa can also enable predictions regarding general patterns in root-associated microbial community assembly.
