Plant-plant competition outcomes are modulated by plant effects on the soil bacterial community  
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-18103-5

What they did:  
The author did a greenhouse experiment with two coexisting plant species in Spain. They monitored their survival and performance as the plants grow measuring inter and intraspecific competition. They used common soil and characterize the soil microbes. They aim to see if the the microbial community would be favored for that of the most competitive plant species.  

What they found:  
They found that interspecific competition altered plant growth and survival. With one species suffering high mortality in the presence of the other and both species had less root mass in the interspecific treatment. Key plant functional traits (specific leaf area and specific root length) changed in response to one species interacting with the other. Lastly, they observed that the microbe community of the interspecific treatment resembled the community of the most competitive plant species.  

Why it matters:  
It matters because to be able to study plant-plant interactions a multitrophic perspective is needed. Soil microbes community influence the the complex interactions between the plant community and this can impact ecosystem funtion and services.
