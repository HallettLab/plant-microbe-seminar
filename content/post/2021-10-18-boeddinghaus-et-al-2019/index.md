## Key questions of the paper
What happens to soil microbes when we change management strategies and plant communities of a site? How quickly is this change reflected in microbial communities? 

## What they did
The authors collected data from 50 field sites in three regions (150 samplings in all). They measured land management intensity (grazing intensity, mowing frequency, N-fertilization), historic land use intensity, soil microbes (microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, six enzymatic activities, microbial community composition), soil properties (pH, temperature, moisture, volumetric soil water content), plant community composition, cover, and biomass, and community weighted means of specific leaf area, leaf P content, leaf N content, and mycorrhizal intensity.

## What they found
Microbial soil properties changed based on both short- and long-term abiotic soil properties, land use, and plant traits. There is a lag between plant community and microbial change. Leaf phosphorus was most important trait in predicting soil microbes in the long-term. "Fast"" plant traits promote active and bacteria-dominated microbe communities.

## Importance

When we change plant communities, we affect a similar change in microbial communities. However, it may take a longer duration than most experimental studies to see this change in our data.

**Figure 4: Summarized results of the structural equation modellings of the South-West and Central regions. Figures a–f show the error-weighted means of standardized estimates over all paths (with minimum and maximum estimates) for microbial variables: biomass (Cmic, Nmic, Pmic, Cmic:Nmic ratio), function (enzyme activities of glucosidase, xylosidase, chitinase, urease, DEA, phosphatase) and community composition (bacterial and fungal PLFA, fungi:bacteria ratio, ergosterol content). Path thickness relates to percentage of significant paths within each variable group. Dotted lines indicate paths that were never significant. The original estimates for each analysed variable and overall path strengths are given in Table S6.2**
