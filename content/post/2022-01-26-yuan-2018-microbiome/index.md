Root exudates drive the soil born legacy of aboveground pathogen infection
Yuan et al. 2018

What they did

Experiment in Michigan using field collected soils to look at how plant's belowground response to aboveground pathogen prepares it for future pathogen. They infected the soil of some pots growing Arabadopsis for 5 generations with Pseudomonas, also infected the leaves.  Then they compared rhizosphere communities and plant communities in sixth generation. Characterized root exudates that structure rhizosphere community.

What they found

Plants in conditioned soils are more disease resistant, pumping out more protein based exudates and less sugars. Adding these exudates directly also suppressed disease. 

Why it matters

Plants can structure belowground microbial communities to help them and future generations even fight disease. Builds on similar research with downy mildew and other diseases where future generations are less affected.  Kind of surprising, because I think of the same species growing in a disease infested area to have a harder time over generations, but there is a mechanism for them to adapt.
