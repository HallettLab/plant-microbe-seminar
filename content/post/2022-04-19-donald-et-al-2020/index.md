_What they did:_ These researchers used the lead endophyte communities of tropical trees to test a classical question in community assembly theory: niche or neutral processes. They collected leaves from the crowns of a variety of tree species in French Guiana. Researchers then used DNA barcoding to characterize both the fungal and bacterial communities in each leaf sample. Finally, they assessed whether communities were more similar within tree species (representing niche processes) or more similar with nearby leaves (representing neutral processes). 

_Why this is cool:_ I really like these sorts of niche v.s. neutral tests. I think it would be fun to have a conversation about the possibilities that are allotted when working with these largely discrete communities of organisms. Using actual microbial communities in the field (as opposed to artificial communities in petri dishes) to test these questions seemed really cool to me.
