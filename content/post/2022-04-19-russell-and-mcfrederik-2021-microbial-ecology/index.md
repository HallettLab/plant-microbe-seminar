Elevated Temperature May Affect Nectar Microbes, Nectar Sugars, and Bumble Bee Foraging Preference  

What they did  
They grew natural nectar microbe communities at different temperatures and evaluated nectar chemistry and bumblebee foraging preference to learn how climate change may impact nectar microbe communities and the implications on plant-pollinator interactions.  

What they found  
Broadly, their study was the first to characterize the Brassica rapa nectar microbiome. Higher temperatures increased the abundance of bacteria, and bumblebees preferred nectar inoculated with microbes but only at ambient temperature.  

What it means  
They show a link between warming temperatures, nectar chemistry, and pollinator behavior. As the global climate warms, pollinators will likely face temperature-induced changes to floral attraction, which could change plant community dynamics.
