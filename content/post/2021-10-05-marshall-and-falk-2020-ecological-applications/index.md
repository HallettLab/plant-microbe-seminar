*Summary:*

The authors used the USFS FIA (Forest Inventory and Analysis) database to look at how altered fire and drought regimes may shift forest composition in the suthern Rocky Mountains. To do this, they created a Community Mean Tolerance Index (CMTI) that parameterizes the relative drought and shade tolerance of various plant communities. They then used this metric to look at community-level demographic changes (comparing adult trees to seedlings, with the goal of identifying areas where interactions between climate change and fire may cause future shifts in plant communities.

The three questions that the address using the CMTI are:

1. Does shade and/or drought tolerance differ significantly between tree and regeneration groups by forest type? Where is the difference maximized?

2. How are drought and shade index differences across demographic groups (mature trees and regeneration)associated with variation in elevation and recent climate across the study space?

3. Can we use the CMTI difference to identify areas undergoing or likely to undergo vegetation type conversion?

*Findings:*
+ They found significant diferences in the CMTI based on elevation. Low-elevation sites showed more influence of drought stress affecting community composition whereas higher-elevation sites showed a trend towards increasing dominance of shade-tolerant species.

+ The biggest demographic differences in CMTI were mid-elevation forests where the fire regime had been altered by fire exclusion.

+ Also, they saw that seedling communities were more homogenous than the mature tree communities, resulting in drought-tolerant plots becoming more drought tolerant and shade-tolerant plots becoming more shade tolerant.

*Why it's interesting:*

+ I appreciate the simple approach that this paper uses to try to create an "early warning of shifts in community functional processes" that could occur as a result of climate change. By comparing mature tree and seedling communities, the paper presents a convenient method for looking at how community traits may change within communities that have much longer regeneration times than annual plant communities.

+ I also appreciate the use of an aggregated community-wide trait metric rather than focusing on species-level trait responses.
