A classic for a reason! Ya'll should read the paper. But for now read this example of how to post. Here's what the structure of the post should look like:

- Title the post with the author, year, and journal
- Name yourself as the author of the post
- Include the week's theme as the category of the post
- Tag relevant topic areas (so that related papers can be grouped) and tag your name (so that we can easily see a compiliation of your entries)  

In the body of the post, provide: 

- A brief summary of what the paper did and why, and key findings
- The reasons you think the paper is notable
- What you would do as a follow-up study

Note that we'd advise using the blogdown New Post addin to initiate a post. You can find this in RStudio -> Tools -> AddIns. Make sure to save your post in post/the theme's folder. The benefit of using the add in is it autopopulates the category and tag options, so we all use the same names for similar things (you can add more if necessary, too!). Please name your post with date-author-year-journal (New Post autopopulates the date). The default is a .md not .Rmd page, so let's just plan on that!
