## A case for conserving plant pathogens

https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ppa.13448

This is a review paper arguing for the conservation of plant pathogens (especially fungi). 

This paper starts by talking about the number of plant species under the threat of extinction and how plant pathogens can sometimes work to promote coexistence and biodiversity in the long-term. The paper makes sure to distinguish between invader and native plant pathogens and the relative effects on the ecosystem.

The paper goes on to talk about the potential benefits of plant pathogens (disease control, weed control, industrial usage, use in model systems, food security). It then discusses several conservation methods both in and ex situ. It works to tie this back to ecosystem as well as human health.
