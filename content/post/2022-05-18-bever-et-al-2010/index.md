__What they did:__ The authors visit multiple ideas in traditional plant community ecology and incorporate soil microbes. They discuss 1) how soil microbes might contribute to resource partitioning, 2) how common mycorrhizal networks might mediate coexistence between competing plant species, and 3) how general shifts in microbial community composition might differentially effect different plant species in a community.

__Why it's cool:__ This was one of the first papers that I read that really connected plant-microbe interactions with a general view of traditional issues and ideas in plant community ecology.I think the authors do a great job of extending PSF theory into a broader set of plant community dynamics than in earlier PSF papers. I also concede that this paper is a bit nostalgic for me.
