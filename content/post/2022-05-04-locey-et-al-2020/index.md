_What they did:_ The authors were interested in the effect of bacterial dormancy on environmental filtering processes and dispersal. They measured active (RNA) and total (DNA) molecular signatures of bacterial communities in forest ponds and generated distance-decay relationships. They then used mechanistic model simulations to assess the potential role of environmental filtering and/or dispersal in shaping observed patterns and how dormancy contributed to these processes.

_Why I liked it:_ Combing observation data with mechanistic model simulations is such a cool way to add assess mechanism in systems where that is difficult. I also think the authors explain the justification and limitations of this approach really well. There are also really pretty rainbow plots of the simulation results that are cool to stare at for awhile.
