**Purpose of study**: It is understood that plants defend against pathogens through their own immunity, however, growing evidence suggests the existence of microbiome-mediated immunity, whereby commensal members of the microbiome prevent colonization or establishment of pathogenic microorganisms onto the host. To investigate the ways in which commensals aid in plant host immunity, Shalev et al. co-inoculated phyllospheres of *Arabidopsis thaliana* with multiple lineages of bacteria within the diverse *Pseudomonas* clade. Inoculations included commensal *Pseudomonas* lineages in addition to one *Pseudomonas* pathogen, which hereafter is referred to as "ATUE5".

**Conclusions and implications**: Co-inocluation of commensal *Pseudomonas* lineages with the ATUE5 pathogen revealed that microbe-induced plant protection is widespead phylogenetically, however, the strength and underlying genetics through which protection is conferred is specific to different *Pseudomonas* lineages (in other words, phylogenetics could not explain the functional variation in commensal *Pseudomonas*-mediated plant protection). Shalev et al. identified commensal genes coding for iron uptake and biofilm production that were important in protecting against the ATUE5 pathogen. Mutant lineages with these genes knocked-out were unsuccessful in defending against ATUE5. They also discovered that these protective genes are not specific against just one pathogen lineage; co-inoculation of commensals with another pathogen (*Pseudomonas syringae* pv. *tomato*) revealed similar functional outcomes of protection. This work demonstrates the significance of commensal members of the microbiome in mediating protection against plant pathogens, which can have agricultural applications related to microbiome therapy. Further, this work provides evidence for functional redundancy among phyllosphere bacteria, whereby phylogenetically distant microbial lineages can undergo metabolic functions that influence host fitness similarly.
