Pathogens and Mutualists as Joint Drivers of Host Species Coexistence and Turnover: Implications for Plant Competition and Succession

In Jiang et al's 2020 paper in The American Naturalist, the authors investigate the joint influence on host coexistence of co-occurring pathogens and mutualists. On their own, pathogens and mutualists respectively can impact host-host interactions, stabilizing through negative feedback or destabilizing through positive feedback, but the combined impact on host coexistence and host turnover of presence of pathogens and mutualists together is more complicated. Here, the authors model the outcomes of host species coexistence when interacting simultaneously with pathogens and mutualists to identify ideal scenarios to promote coexistence. Their model indicated that accumulating pathogens or mutualists can drive successional turnover in plant hosts depending on interspecific differences in plant life-history traits. In contrast to mutualists, the accumulation of which can generate positive feedback during succession which can be a necessary but not sufficient to generate successional dynamics, pathogens are only able to drive succession when the late-successional species is the most pathogen resistant. Their study highlights the benefit for future experiments to parse out the independent input of pathogens and mutualists over time, because there seems to be different roles across successional stages.
