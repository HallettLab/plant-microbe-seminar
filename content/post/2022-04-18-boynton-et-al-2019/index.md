**Superior Dispersal Ability Can Lead to Persistent Ecological
Dominance throughout Succession**

Boynton PJ, Peterson CN, Pringle A. 2019. Appl Environ Microbiol 85:e02421-18. https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02421-18.

**Summary:**

+ This study looks at microbial community assembly inside of the carnivorous purple pitcher plant (*Sarracenia purpurea*). They look at successional changes in fungal community composition over the 3 month period that the pitchers are open and hosting microbes. The study aims to identify the traits (dispersal vs. competitive ability) that enable dominance within these communities. To do this, they sampled water from 43 pitcher plants in a single *Sphagnum* bog (the metacommunity) at four different timepoints. They also conduct a laboratory microcosm experiment to test the competitive abilities of 
4 focal yeasts.

**Findings:**

+ They found that the yeast *Candida pseudoglaebosa* was the dominant component of the microbial community within the pitcher plants even though it was not a superior competitor. *C. pseudoglaebosa* has a high dispersal ability, allowing it to be the dominant component of the metacommunity (and the most frequent fungal taxon at every timepoint) even though it did not dominate in every pitcher plant.


**Why it's interesting:**

+ A relatively straightforward community assembly story with a twist--the early disperser does not get replaced by superior competitors during succession (and instead maintains metacommunity dominance).
