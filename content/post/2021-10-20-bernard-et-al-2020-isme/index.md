##What they did and found

They examined epiphtytic microbes in 8 microhabitats form Hibiscus trees across a steep gradient with in a Hawaiian watershed to investigate how environmental context relates to plant microhabitat microbial assembly. They used bacterial and fungal sequence and compared communtities among the gradietn and between the microhabitats (soil, air, leaf, stems, petioles, axils). They found that communities are determined more by location along the environmental gradient than by microhabitat type. But, fungal communities had a high variation of distance decay patterns among microhabitat type. Bacteria community compositional variance was better explained by microhabitat than by location, and communities associated barely with different microhabitats.

##Importance

This study shows how plant bacterial and community assembly vary due to the scale applied whether it be large scale environmental gradients or by just looking at different plant parts. This could further help us eludicate the functional traits and roles of fungi that uniquely distribute to different parts of plants.
