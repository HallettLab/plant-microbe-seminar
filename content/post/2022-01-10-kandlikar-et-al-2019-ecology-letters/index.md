The goal of this paper was to use Modern Coexistence Theory to draw attentiont to and define how microbes might contribute to plant fitness inequalities. The authors work from Bever's original plant-soil feedback theory and go on to integrate this theory with Chesson's modern coexistence theory. They relate Bever's stabilisation metric (I) to Chesson's stabilisation term in his invader growth rate decomposition, and they develop a measure of fitness differences from Bever's plant-soil feedback framework. They also create flexible models of plant-microbe interactions as to predict the outcome of competition between plant species with the addition of soil microbes. Finally, they apply their models to a set of scenarios in which accounting for fitness inequalites (as opposed to just stabilisation) is necessary for accurate predictions of competitive outcomes.
