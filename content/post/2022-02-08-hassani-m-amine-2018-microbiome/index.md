# Microbial interactions within the plant holobiont

*M. Amine Hassani, Paloma Durán & Stéphane Hacquard*

## What they did:

This review focuses on three microbial groups (bacteria, fungi and protists) that are abundantly found on plant tissues and briefly describes the diverse mechanisms used by these microbes to cooperate and **compete** in planta and also how these microbial interactions represent important organizational rules structuring the plant microbiota as well as their impact on plant growth and health

## What they concluded:

Combining both empirical approaches and computationally inferred association networks will be crucial to understand the ecology of microbial interactions during plant-microbiota establishment, to better predict assembly and stability of natural or synthetic microbial communities, and to better define the dynamics of microbial community establishment in time and in space

## Why is it important:

Plants live in intimate association with complex and diverse microbial communities. Next-generation sequencing has already enabled us to explore different microbial groups through the targeting of specific microbial loci or using environmental metagenomes. Nonetheless, a more holistic understanding is still needed to better understand the intermicrobial interactions within the microbiota of plants and to better define the functional relevance of the microbial networks for holobiont fitness
