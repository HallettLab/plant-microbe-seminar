**Using proxies of microbial community-weighted means traits to explain the cascading effect of management intensity, soil and plant traits on ecosystem resilience in mountain grasslands**

**Objective:** First, use proxies of microbial community weighted mean (CWM) traits to infer tradeoffs in resource use strategies in microbial communities along a management intensity gradient. Second, investigate the effects on ecosystem resilience to drought.

**What they did:** The authors measured microbial biomass and enzyme stoichiometry, and mass-specific enzymes activity as proxies of CWM traits.They describe these CWM traits using the copiotrophic (high growth rates, low resistance to environmental stress) to oligotrophic (low growth rate, high resistance to stress) continuum. Authors then simulated a drought on intact plant-soil mesocosms that were extracted from a management intensity gradient in mountain grasslands and characterized ecosystem processes/properties related to N cycling before, during, and after drought to characterize ecosystem resilience. 

**What they found:** Grassland management intensity indirectly drove soil microbial CWM traits through soil nutrients and plant CWM traits. High soil nutrient levels and exploitative plants selected for microbial communities with a copiotrophic strategy while nutrient poor soils and conservative plants favored oligotrophic microbial strategies. Variation in microbial CWM traits influenced ecosystem resilience to drought. Copiotrophic microbial communities showed low resistance but high recovery to drought, while oligotrophic communities showed the opposite. 

**Importance:** They posit that including microbial communities in the response-effect trait framework will lead to better understanding of the mechanisms driving ecosystem responses to global changes.
