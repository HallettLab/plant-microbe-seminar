# Title: Spatial Heterogeneity in Soil Microbes Alters Outcomes of Plant Competition

# Who they are:  
Karen Abbott is a theoretical ecologist at Case Western Reserve University, and she co-directs their IRIHSE Program, which includes paid summer research opportunities for CWRU undergraduates from groups historically underrepresented in science.  
  
# What they did:  
They use modeling to understand the effect spatiotemporal differences in soil mutualists and seed dispersal on competition between plants that are either responsive or non-responsive to such soil mutualists. They use the model to consider scenarios of invasion and succession. For the invasion scenario, they look at California grassland communities where native plants outcompete invasives in the presence of native AM fungi, but are outcompeted in their absence, to test whether the conditions that lead to invasion are impacted by plant dispersal between microbe-containing and microbe-free areas. For the succession scenario, they use their model to examine whether positive plant-soil feedbacks generated by differences in responsiveness to soil mutualists in a patchy distribution can explain patterns of replacement during early succession, or whether other plant or soil traits also play a role.
