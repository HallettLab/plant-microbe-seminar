**Ectomycorrhizal fungal decay traits along a soil nitrogen gradient**
*Pellitier and Zak 2021*
<https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17734>
 
 

* Why it’s interesting/important: 

-Plants can associate with dozens of mycorrhizal fungal partners at a given time, and different consortia of mycorrhizal fungal traits can result in different emergent functional outcomes for a host plant. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are particularly diverse in their functional abilities/traits, due to the fact that the ectomycorrhizal association has evolved convergently approximately 80 different times. Some relevant traits include: hyphal foraging strategies, functional capacity to decompose organic matter. 
 
 
-Forest ecosystems’ response to consequences of climate change (i.e. elevated CO2) can be limited or controlled by the bioavailability of nitrogen to trees/plants. ECM fungal partners can vary significantly in their abilities to access certain N-rich resources in SOM, which may “short-circuit” the traditional inorganic N nutrient economy. This can scale up to impact ecosystem and global-scale SOM dynamics, depending on which ECM fungal taxa/traits are present and functioning in a given forest. 
 
 

* What they did: 

-They utilized a natural inorganic N gradient in soils around oak trees (*Quercus rubra*) in Michigan to see if the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities associating with host trees exhibited different emergent properties in terms of their explorative traits and functional capacities to degrade soil organic matter. This was in order to test their hypothesis that ECM fungal communities in soils with low inorganic N availability generally have greater functional potential to decompose soil organic matter in order to free up bioavailable/inorganic N for their host trees.  

-To address this they utilized both amplicon sequencing of root tips (almost 15,000!) to determine “who’s there” in the fungal community, in addition to shotgun metagenomic sequencing (pretty much all fragments of DNA in the samples/not only “who’s there” but also functional potential).  
 
 
 
 
* What they found: 

-The exploration strategies of ECM fungi varied significantly with net N mineralization. They also modeled relationships between net N mineralization and relative abundance of particular gene families associated with decomposition of major SOM substrates such as cellulose, lignin, chitin, etc. 
 
 
-ECM fungal composition significantly varied with soil pH, rate of N mineralization, and ratios of total C to N. Even the amount of ECM root tips they found in their samples was negatively correlated with inorganic N availability, with most ECM fungal diversity in the soils with low inorg. N availability (sort of).
