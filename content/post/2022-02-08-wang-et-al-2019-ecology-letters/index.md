**Soil microbiome mediates positive plant diversity-productivity relationships in late successional grassland species**
*Wang et al 2019, Ecology Letters*
<https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13273>

- What they did:	They performed two experiments to test whether differences in the soil microbiome (specifically arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and putative fungal pathogens) mediate plant biodiversity-productivity relationships in prairie grass mixed and monoculture ecological scenarios. Their first experiment tested diversity-productivity relationships using 15 different combinations of plants (3 spp varying in frequency), inoculated with four soil treatments (3 different sources of inocula + a sterilized control). Their second experiment utilized the same soils as experiment 1, but tested for soil-feedback effects on the same three plant species grown individually. Their hypotheses address both plant diversity-productivity relationships in addition to plant-soil feedbacks and frequency dependence under pathogen pressure.

- What they found:	Their mesocosm experiments support the notion that plant diversity-productivity relationships largely depend on the soil microbiome in which the plants are grown, and that more diverse/late successional soil microbiota drive more positive diversity-productivity relationships. They also found evidence for two mechanisms by which the soil microbiome mediated diversity-productivity relationships: through resource partitioning among neighboring plants, and host-specific pathogens suppressing growth within multiple-species mesocosms.

- Why it’s interesting/important:	I thought this paper was cool because the two experiments together examined the roles of different functional groups of fungi (mutualists and pathogens) in mediating different outcomes of plant competition and coexistence. They also address the implications of these results for restoration efforts for late-successional plant communities to be paired with late successional soil microbiota.

- Who they are:	This paper is out of James Bever and Peggy Schultz’s group at the University of Kansas. James Bever wrote some of the canonical papers on plant-soil feedbacks, and their lab group’s past and current work are worth following if you don’t already! <https://beverlab.ku.edu/>
