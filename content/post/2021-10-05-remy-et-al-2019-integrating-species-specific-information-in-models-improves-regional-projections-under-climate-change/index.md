## Purpose of Study 

- Global models often simplify species' characteristics in response to climate change, which fit the data well enough at the ecosystem scale but scale up with large uncertainties
- Quantify differences in model parameterization with respect to projected carbon dynamics and vegetation trajectories, through simulating climate sensitivity of carbon dynamics in woody vegetation ecosystems in New Mexico
- To improve management strategies in a changing climate, especially over the next century, species‐specific parameterization is needed to improve modelling
with respect to ecosystem functioning 

## Study Conclusions and Implications

This study elucidated large discrepancies among generalized functional type and a species‐specific model parameterization after 200 years using LANDIS-II forest landscape model in three woody vegetation ecosystems. Both model parameterizations were compared with eddy-covariance flux tower and empirical data. Since such large discrepancies exist, for management practices, it is imperative to improve species-specific parameter values to better predict ecosystem function shifts in response to climate change. 

## Future Directions
-Large scale data mining of species-specific effects in response to climate change
-Finding stronger correlations between generalized and species-specific parameters
