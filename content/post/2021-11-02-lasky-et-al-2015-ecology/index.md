Ontogenetic shifts in trait-mediated mechanisms of plant community assembly

In this paper, Lasky et al asked how tree functional traits and trait relationship to crowding and interspecific differences with neighbors varied across 3 life stage categories in the outcomes of tree survival, growth and demography. The authors hypothesized that trade-offs between functional trait relationships throughout a trees life would contribute to niche differences allowing for greater species coexistence and therefore higher species diversity as well as community ass
To ask these questions the authors took advantage of a long term forest study site in Puerto Rico where there is high tree diversity and detailed data has been collected on seedling survival and species growth for 20+ years. The five functional traits selected(seed size, SLA, maximum height, leaf N and wood density) were chosen as they represent fundamental trade-offs in life-history differentiation among tree species. The three ontogenetic classes used were seedlings, size class 1 and size class 2. 
Overall the authors did not find many significant shifts between ontogenetic stages and species trait relationships. Only in terms of how species traits relate to their response to overcrowding were significant differences seen between ontogenetic stages. The study showed that in some cases looking at species traits and the relationships traits may have with various responses is important to do at a finer scale(multiple life stages) not just averaged for a species as a whole. Even though there seem to be mixed results it still seems like a very interesting question to pursue- as species face very different limiting resources and competitive pressures throughout their life cycle, functional trait trade-offs may be a component of species coexistence and species assembly.
