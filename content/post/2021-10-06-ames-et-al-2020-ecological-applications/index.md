Background: Reintroducing rare species is a common practice in conservation, that often results in poor survival of rare individuals. Reintroduction sites are typically chosen based on historical occupancy or abiotic factors, with less thought given to the existing biotic community. 

Objective: To increase survival of rare species during reintroductions, authors tested how functional similarity between the reintroduced species and the local community affected survival. 

What they did: The study took place in the Sandhills ecoregion of North Carolina, which is characterized by upland longleaf pine savanna and lowland pond pine and mixed hardwood forest. Authors reintroduced 4 species and monitored demographics & survival for one year. They also measured 12 functional traits related to growth, survival, and flammability in the reintroduced species and local community. Finally, they calculated the functional similarity of reintroduced individuals to the local community using a multivariate community weighted mean.

Key Findings: Higher functional similarity between reintroduced individuals and the local community increased survival of the rare species and was a stronger predictor of survival than variation in abiotic factors. 

Importance: Functional composition of the biotic community should be taken into account when selecting sites to improve rare species reintroduction success.
