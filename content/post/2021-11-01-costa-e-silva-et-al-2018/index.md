# Evidence that divergent selection shapes a developmental cline in a forest tree species complex

The authors compared the development of two *Eucalyptus* species in a common garden study. One species, *E. tenuiramus*, is *heteroblastic*, meaning that the juvenile plant has leaves that look substantially different than leaves of the adult plant (image below shows heteroblasty in a different *Eucalyptus* species). The other species, *E. risdonii*, is *homoblastic* and has juvenile leaves that look similar to adult leaves. They found that plants from more arid sites retained their juvenile leaves longer than plants from more mesic sites. This result suggests that heteroblasty is an adaptive trait.
