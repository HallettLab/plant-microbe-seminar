##Goal
The authors wanted to improve oak regeneration after prescribed burns through disentangling burning effects with respect to soil microbial communities, inter and intra-specific competition and their subsequent interactions. 

##Approach
- amplicon sequencing (soil microbes)
- glasshouse experiment (inter and intra-species competition; burned vs unburned soil)

##Importance/Conclusions
The authors found that soil fungi diversity decreased with respect to fire and that plant pathogenic fungi also decreased with fire. However, oak regeneration was stronger in burned soils with interspecific competition due to belowground root partitioning (ectonetwork).
