This review paper from E-Vojtko et al. from Journal of Vegetation Science points out that floral traits have largely been left out of studies looking at plant functional traits, with studies mainly focusing on leaf-height-seed traits. E-Vojtko et al. hypothesize that floral traits may be in community assembly, noting that floral traits are highly relevant for phylogeny. A large proportion of studies reviewed are pollination studies, where the authors note there slightly different approaches to plant-pollinator community studies than to solely plant community assembly studies. The difference in these studies the authors note make it difficult to accept or reject their hypothesis as the plant-pollinator studies that most often include floral trait data are not complete surveys of a community but specific clades within a community. 
The authors are able to determine looking at the literature that there are some correlations between floral traits and environmental gradients at a local scale suggesting floral traits may be relevant to look at at filters for community assemble. Additionally they note at larger biome scales there is also evidence of filtering as areas such as the tropics have a high percentage of plant species that are animal pollinated. 
While E-Vojtko et al. are not able to make many overarching statements about floral trait importance for understanding community assemble from their literature review they detail the reasons for this and ways to best collect floral trait data in future studies to look into this question further. They argue while the current literature does not allow them to make these overarching statements the data collected so far supports their opinion that spending more effort to collect and look at floral traits for community asssemble is a promising path.
