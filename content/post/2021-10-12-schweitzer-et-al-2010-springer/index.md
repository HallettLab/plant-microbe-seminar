Forest gene diversity is correlated with the composition and function of soil microbial communities

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10144-010-0252-3

This paper showed the relationship between gene diversity and composition/function of soil microbe communities in Populus spp. dominated forests. This paper "found significant unimodal patterns relating gene diversity to soil microbial community composition, microbial exoenzyme activity of a carbon-acquiring enzyme, and availability of soil nitrogen."

I think this paper is notable because it links microbe community function to forest trait function. The paper initially frames the study from the 'plant function' side, but I think that the paper could also be framed from the 'microbe side' given that the correlation was strong.

A follow up study could be to check other Populus species or mixed species forests and determine how strong the correlation is. After all, maybe it's the microbes that are actually doing the hard work?
