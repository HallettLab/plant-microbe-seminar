**Anatomy promotes neutral coexistence of strains in the human skin microbiome**  
Conwill, A., Kuan, A.C., Damerla, R., Poret, A.J., Baker, J.S., Tripp, A.D., Alm, E.J., & Lieberman, T.D. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2021.12.007  

**Purpose of Study**: The authors were interested in examining the drivers of coexistence between microbial strains within a host microbiome. Here, they focused specifically on the most ubiquitous taxon within the human skin microbiome, *Cutibacterium acnes*. The authors asked if the anatomy/topology of the human skin surface may act as a colonization filter through which coexistence of *C. acnes* strains is promoted.  

**Conclusions and implications:** Whole-genome sequences of *C. acnes* across individual skin pores revealed significant pore-level spatial structuring of *C. acnes* strains. Colonies of *C. acnes* that were isolate from the same individual pore were nearly clones of one another (<1 nucleotide mutation apart), suggesting considerably low within-pore diversity. Similarly, the topology of human skin pores promotes population fragmentation between *C. acnes* strains, effectively limiting competition (thus promoting coexistence) between strain genotypes. These results provide greater insights into the ways in which host anatomy and tissue topology can influence coexistence between microbial taxa within the microbiome.
