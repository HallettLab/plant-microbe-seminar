__What they did__: To _understand mechanisms of coexistence between fine root endophytes (FRE) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)_ the authors assess potential environmental covariates (P, K, S, organic C, Al, pH, CaCl2, rainfall, temperature) of root associated fungal communities (diversity, root colonization, community composition). They assessed potential relationships between covariates and response variables using structural equation models and canonical correspondence analysis. 

__What they found__: FRE and AMF responded similarly to some covariates, but dissimilarly to others. They suggest that contrasting responses to particular environmental factors might indicate niche differentiation between the two groups of fungi. However they also find that the covariates had differing effects on their response variables (colonization, diversity and community composition). 

__Why it's cool__: This is a pretty cool example of research illucidating community dynamics at the fungal level. Especially interesting is an emphasis on describing ecological differences between AMF and another group of root endophytes. I also wanted to read more papers using SEMs.
