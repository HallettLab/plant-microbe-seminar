**Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community composition determines the competitive response of two grassland forbs**

Neuenkamp L, Zobel M, Lind E, Gerz M, Moora M (2019) Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community composition determines the competitive response of two grassland forbs. PLoS ONE 14(7): e0219527. https://doi.org/10.1371/ journal.pone.0219527

**What they did:**

Greenhouse experiment in Estonia to see how different innoculated AM communities affect compeition between two forbs and dominant grass, all of which use AM typically. 

Collected soil from open grassland and successional pine forest. Filtered out smaller bacteria and spores to just have AM left. 

**Findings:**
Grassland soils had more diversity and abundance of AM fungi. 

Grassland innoculation benefited the forbs (biomass response) more than forest innoculation, but both > control and more forest-living forb had better effects from the forest soil. 

**Why it's interesting:**

It's a controlled experiment focusing specifically on the microbial effect on competition and it worked! Not commercial cultures, but collected from actual soils in different environments.
