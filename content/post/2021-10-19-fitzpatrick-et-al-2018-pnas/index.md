# Assembly and ecological function of the root microbiome across angiosperm plant species

# What they did and found
*They show that variation among 30 angiosperm species, which have diverged for up to 140 million years, affects root bacterial diversity and composition. 
*Their analysis of plant traits revealed that plant productivity and physiology are associated with variation in root microbiome diversity and composition. These physiological traits are often correlated with broad resource acquisition strategies employed across plant species, suggesting that plant resource consumption and turnover are correlated with root microbiota.
*They found that greater similarity in root microbiomes between hosts leads to negative effects on plant performance through soil feedback, with specific microbial taxa in the endosphere and rhizosphere potentially affecting competitive interactions among plant species.
*Drought also shifts the composition of root microbiomes, most notably by increasing the relative abundance of the Actinobacteria. However, this drought response varies across host plant species, and host-specific changes in the relative abundance of endosphere Streptomyces are associated with host drought tolerance.

# Importance
*Root associated microbes were key for the evolution of land plants and underlie fundamental ecosystem processes. They revealed that plant evolution has shaped root microbial communities, and in turn, these microbes affect plant ecology, such as the ability to mitigate biotic and abiotic stressors.
