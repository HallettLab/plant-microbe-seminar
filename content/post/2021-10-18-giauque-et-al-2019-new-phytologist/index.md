Background:
Fungal endophytes live within the tissues of most terrestrial plants. Many are asymptomatic, but some provide benefits to their plant hosts. They can alter plant response to environmental stressors such as drought and herbivory. 

What they did:
They planted 35 unique pairs of Panicum virgatum seeds with different fungal endophytes across a well-watered to drought gradient. They then measured plant response to the drought by looking at growth, physiology, and survival.  

What they found:
Using the fungal species as a factor, they were able to explain 26-53% of the variation in plant response to drought conditions. This indicates that the endophytes have a large effect upon plants under stress conditions. 

Importance:
Understanding the response of plants to environmental events such as drought is important for restoration and agriculture, especially in the face of climate change.
