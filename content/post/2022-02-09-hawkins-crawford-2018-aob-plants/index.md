**Interactions between plants and soil microbes may alter the relative importance of intraspecific and interspecific plant competition in a changing climate**

**Objective**: The environment can alter the direction and magnitude of plant-microbe interactions - a context dependency which might ultimately alter interactions between plant species. The authors tested whether water availability mediates the effect of soil microbes on pairwise plant interactions in the TX coastal prairie.

[an aside: their seeds are sourced from MN and NY, so actually not really in the TX coastal prairie, although their soil was from TX coastal prairies. seems an odd choice!]

**What they did**: They did a greenhouse experiment with a factorial combination of three watering treatments (low, medium, high) crossed with two soil treatments (live and sterile). They grew three grassland species: Plantago lanceolata, Rudbeckia hirta, and Schizachyrium scoparium (my favorite grass!). They took soil samples from the TX coastal prairie, homogenized the samples, and used this to create their inoculum.

**What they found**: The presence of soil microbes increased the strength of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition but this effect depended on water availability.

**Who is doing the research**: 
Anna Hawkins was a Master's student in the Crawford lab. Kerri Crawford is an associate professor at the University of Houston.
