Background: 
Plants that traditionally coexisted may not be able to in the future due to different disturbances and/or stressors. The example in this paper is the combined effects of pathogens and climate change on three Quercus species in the Mediterranean.

What they did:
A greenhouse experiment! They grew three Quercus species together under several conditions. 1) a control, 2) pathogen, 3) pathogen + drought, 4) pathogen + heat, 5) pathogen + heat + drought. They then measured several vital statistics to see how the trees were impacted, and how it might influence coexistence over time. 

What they found:
The pathogen had a far larger impact on the tree species when combined with stress from environmental factors. Also, some trees were far more susceptible than others. The implication is that patterns of coexistence may shift with climate change as well as globalization of plant pathogens.
