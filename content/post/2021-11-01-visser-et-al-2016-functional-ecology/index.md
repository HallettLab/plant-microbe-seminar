Functional traits as predictors of vital rates across the life cycle of tropical trees

Background: Predictive power of functional traits regarding plant demography is typically low. The authors wanted to see if the importance of different functional traits changed with the lifestage of different tropical tree species. 

What they did: They evaluated the predictive power of four functional traits across the lifecycle stages of 136 species of trees found in Panama. 

How they did it: Modeling. They averaged the functional traits against five fitness measurements across three life stages.

What they found: Different functional traits were more or less important at different lifecycle stages. They also differentially affected fitness measurements at different stages.
