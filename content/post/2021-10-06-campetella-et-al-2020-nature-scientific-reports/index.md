**Plant functional traits are correlated with species persistence in the herb layer of old-growth beech forests**
 
*Campetella et al 2020*
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76289-7>
 
* What they did:  

They performed surveys over 8 years in four old-growth forests that represent two distinct climates to see whether plant traits correlated with species persistence. The sites represented presence and absence of summer drought along a latitudinal gradient in Italy. They measured several traits such as leaf anatomy, seed mass, specific leaf area, vegetative mobility and perennial bud bank belowground.
 
 
 
* What they found:  

There were clear patterns between species persistence and sets of specific functional traits across sites, where the reproductive strategies and acquisitive vs conservative resource use strategies differed between Northern and Southern beech forests. Specifically, the sites without summer drought favored persistence of species with higher seed mass while more ruderal functional traits were favored in sites experiencing more annual climate variability/drought stress (i.e. clonal/resprouting ability).
 
 
* Why is it interesting/important:   

I thought this paper was straightforward in its approach examining the effects of climate variability on vegetation dynamics in a natural setting. I thought the shifts in functional traits of persistent plant species under more variable climate was pretty cool especially since the patterns seem to be shifting in the direction you would expect in a relatively more stressful environment.
