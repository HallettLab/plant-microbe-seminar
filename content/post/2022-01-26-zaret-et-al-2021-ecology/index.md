**Conspecific leaf litter induces negative feedbacks in Asteraceae seedlings**

- What they did:	This paper aimed to characterize the role of plant phyllosphere feedbacks (PPFs) - an extension of plant soil feedbacks/PSFs - to determine how plant phyllosphere microbiota impact the growth of con- and heterospecific plants in the Asteraceae family. They used a greenhouse experiment with 10 different species in the Asteraceae representing different life history strategies, where they inoculated seedlings with recently senesced plant litter from either the same species or each of nine heterospecific species, and measured root and shoot biomass after three weeks. They also had a separate experiment where they measured several functional traits and phylogenetic distance between all species pairs. The authors hypothesized that negative conspecific PPFs would be widespread in their experiment, but also that the heterospecific pairs with the highest life history/functional trait dissimilarity would experience more negative PPFs.

- What they found:	They found that the conspecific litter inoculant generally had a negative PPF response for all 10 species, with 4/10 of the species experiencing significantly reduced growth with conspecific litter compared to heterospecific litter treatments. The measurements of plant functional traits and phylogenetic distance had little to no effect on PPFs, which they suggested means that other mechanisms or traits are driving differences in PPFs.

- Why itâ€™s interesting/important:	I thought this paper was interesting because we often discuss plant soil feedbacks, where soil microbiota influence the growth and coexistence of different plant species, but rarely are litter/leaf microbiota considered. In the McGuire lab, we have found that soil and litter microbial communities can differ significantly in their composition, particularly pathogens, so I thought these authors performed a neat experiment to test the effects of plant species-specific litter microbes on seedling growth and survival.
