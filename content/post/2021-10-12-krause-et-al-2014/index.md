## What they did:

In this review, Krause et al. highlights studies that have focused on biodiversity - ecosystem functioning (BEF) in microbial systems and discusses the importance of future work focusing on . They also discuss the differences between manipulated diversity and comparative studies when wanting to study traits. Lastly, they go over the importance of taxonomy and identifying traits and trait trade-offs at the single cell or organism level. The grimes CSR model is used to sort traits and life strategies that could be used for microbial systems.

## Conclusions:
 
1. Microbial BEF research should implement experiments that study the role of microbial trait based diversity on ecosystem functioning. Manipulative community studies are still crucial work, despite them not being natural environments. 
2.Microbial ecologists should promote measuring and archiving of microbial traits in a standard way therefore they can be used in a variety of dynamic environments.
