Mechanisms and Consequences of Facilitation in Plant Communities: Influence of soil microbiota in nurse plant systems

British Ecological Society Functional Ecology

Sarah

This paper is a synthesis on the role of soil microbes in nurse plants. Nurse plants facilitate greater diversity and abundance of other plants by creating favorable microclimates via shading and higher soil moisture, however the authors demostrate how these facilitative interactions are generally studied without considering the role of soil microbes. 
The authors highlight all the ways soil microbes, particularly AM fungi and bacteria create favorable environments for new plant growth the same way nurse plants do, and what is know about the variation in microbes between soil around vs away from nurse plants. There is a some knowledge of nurse plant microbiomes but studies have usually been done independent of plant measurements. 
The authors do a really nice job of conceptually framing potential interaction networks and convincing one that previous plant-plant facilitation studies would benefit greatly by adding in soil microbes.
