## Purpose of Study 
This study measured labelled 15N uptake by different plant species to determine how late season thawing of permafrost influences nitrogen uptake. Researchers measured functional traits of different species to better understand what facilitates higher N uptake. 

## Study Conclusions and Implications
Deep rooted graminoid and forb species wtih fungal associates access depp N immediately, however forbs incorporated more N over a longer timescale. Increased productivity of shrub species may slightly offset carbon loss from thawing permafrost. 

## Future Directions
- Modelling of root and N interactions to better understand how the regional carbon balance will be impacted.
