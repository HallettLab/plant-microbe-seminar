The study highlights the effect of soil microbes and soil crust and their interaction with plants on self limiting traits in plant and consequently the higher probability of seeing plant coexistence because of these self limitations in growth.

The species that are being studied are B. gracilis (Poaceae, blue grama) and B. eriopoda (Poaceae, black grama)
