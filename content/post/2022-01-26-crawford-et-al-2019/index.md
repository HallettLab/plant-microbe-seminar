# What they did
The authors investigated the relative importance of plant traits, evolutionary history,and abiotic factors for coexistence through Plant Soil Feedbacks by using a meta-analysis. 

# What they found
They found that just as with with predictions, feedback is more likely to mediate coexistence for pairs of plant species that are:
- associating with similar guilds of mycorrhizal fungi
- of increasing phylogenetic distance
- interacting with native microbes. 
Furthermore, they also suggest that pathgens can and do play a primary role of feedback-mediated coexistence. 

# Why is it interesting
Plant-soil feedbacks can help us understand plant dynamics by investigating predictors of soil community stabilization through plant–plant interactions. Yet, there isn't much know about feedback-driven coexistence. The authors state that this is because of a failure to analyse therse particualar pairwise reltionships. By combining results over several independent studies, their results confirm that plant-soil feedbacks may play a key role in plant species coexistence, species invasion, and phylogenetic diversity of plant communities.
