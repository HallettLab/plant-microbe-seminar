**Diversity within mutualist guilds promotes coexistence and reduces the risk of invasion from an alien mutualist**

- This paper investigated competitive dynamics in a guild of mutualists that associate with a common partner using an ordinary differential equation model, aiming to predict how successful an alien mutualist would be at invading the community. To address their aims, they used arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal mutualists associating with plants, where differences in AM fungal composition translates into shifts in resource dynamics, since the resource availability (C from host plants) is intrinsically connected to the benefits provided by AM fungi. 

- The results of their models suggest that mutualists that are weak competitors facilitate coexistence of a diverse community of mutualists that would otherwise exclude each other, by means of increasing resource availability (providing plants with increased benefits, therefore increasing C flow to AM fungi). They outline several scenarios of invasion by alien AM fungal species (different traits, composition of recipient community and propagule pressure) and provide a nice discussion of different outcomes.

- I chose this paper because I figured there will be a lot of papers out there investigating coexistence of plants (and how microbes play a role in plant coexistence), while this paper considers the coexistence within AM fungal communities competing for the same resource (C provided by host plants). I am also super interested in the role of mutualisms shaping community dynamics in general.
