##Why is it important

Ontogenetic shifts in plants’ ecological and evolutionary significance remain largely unknown. As such, age-specific environmental filters are expected to drive resource-investment strategies for a given developmental stage. This study reveals ontogeny-dependent strategies and offers as approach to integrate plant development and functional specialization.

##What they did

Dayrell et al. tested whether species exhibited strategies during early developmental stages – in relation to vulnerability and habitat-dependent strategies that optimise resource acquisition in later life stages. They measured key leaf traits such as: leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and specific leaf area. Additionally, they calculated the CSR in the system for juveniles and conspecific adults in “unproductive” grasslands and “productive” forests.

##What they found

They found that juveniles who exhibited higher SLA and LA, and lower LDMC, had a more R-strategy in both habitats when compared with adults. In addition, they found a smaller intraspecific variation for the R-strategy in adults compared with juveniles. On the other hand, variation within other strategies was significantly habitat-dependent. They conclude that ontogenetic shifts in these strategies appear to have been selected as a response to ontogeny-dependent filters. As such, strategies that are dependent on habitat productivity and are relatively R-selected in juveniles, shift towards C and/or S strategies in adulthood. However, habitat-dependent specialization is in fact a major driver of ecological strategy selection in juveniles.
