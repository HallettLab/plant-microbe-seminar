__Overview__
The goal of this paper was to extend traditional coexistence theory (Tilman's R* theory) to thinking about the role of mutualists in mediating coexistence. The authors develop models that assess 1) How competition within a guild for a shared mutualist partner effects competition, 2) Whether this form of competition is functionally different from direct resource competition or apparent competition exerted by some shared enemy, and 3) How this form of competition helps or hinders the mutualist. 

__Why it's cool__
I enjoyed this paper firstly because it builds upon traditional theory in a really clear way to ask a pertinent question about the role of mutualists in mediating coexistence. This paper also drew my attention to some nuances of mutualisms that I hadn't considered (e.g. the distinction between resource exchange mutualisms and resource-service exchange mutualisms). Finally, this paper offers enough generality that we can hit on pollination (though most of the pollinator models are in an appendix) while also clarifying that these mutualisms are biologically and mathematically differen from microbes.
