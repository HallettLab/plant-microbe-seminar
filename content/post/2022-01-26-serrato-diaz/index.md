Pathogens Causing Anthracnose and Fruit Rots of Coffee Associated with
the Coffee Berry Borer and the Entomopathogenic FungusBeauveria 
bassianain Puerto Rico.

Like many heavily agricultured crops, coffee is prone to diseases. 
Infections with the fungi of the genus *Colletotrichum* have caused the
coffee fruit to rot rapidly. It is not yet known who works as a vector 
but it is believed that the coffee berry borer (CBB) is the carrier and
responsible for infecting the fruit. Another important fungi for the 
coffee plant is *Beauveria bassiana*, which is a natural enemy to the 
CBB. In this study they aim to determine if the CBB is indeed 
responsible for the transmission of *Colletotrichum* and determine if 
*B. bassiana* can be used as natural biological control to decrease 
fruit rot intensity. Overall, fruit that were exposed to CBB that was 
inoculated with *C. conidia* would rot more when compared to non 
incoculated CBB exposure. As for *B. bassiana* as biological control, 
fruit that were inoculated with both the pathogenic fungi and *B. 
bassiana* had significantly less rot than those inoculated with just 
the pathogen. This is an important because it suggest that *B. 
bassiana* can potentially be a pest control that can be considered in 
disease management.
