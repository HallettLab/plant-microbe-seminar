#What they did: 
The main question they asked was how do plant-pollinator interactions impact the microbial community composition and diversity? They sampled the nectar of 282 flowers of 48 plant species with beetles, birds, and other insects as pollinators in South Africa.

#What they found: 
They showed that plant-pollinator interactions played a crucial role in shaping microbial communities. Plants visited by different pollinator guilds supported significantly different yeast and bacterial communities. Specifically, plants visited by beetles supported the highest richness and phlogenetic diversity of yeast, while bacterial communities were significantly more diverse in plants visited by other insect groups.

#Importance: 
Plants visited by the same pollinator guild have a characteristic nectar microbiota signature that may transcends the geographic region they are in.
