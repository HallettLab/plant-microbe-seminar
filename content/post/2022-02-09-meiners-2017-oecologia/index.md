Soil microbial communities alter leaf chemistry and influence allelopathic potential among coexisting plant species

Soil microbe communities affect specific competition mechanism of allelopathy.


What they did

Experimentally manipulated soil microbial community for four grassland species (two Aster and two Solidago), looked at allopathic compounds in leaves. They conditioned field collected soils by growing plants from each species in the greenhouse and in field monocultures.  These two soils were pooled. 

What they found

Plants growing in their own soils germinate better and have less allelopathic leaves than heterospecifics. There is less allelopathy happening when grown with conspecifics. For soils with microbe communiteis of interspecific plants, it didnt matter if the competitor was more closely or distantly related.  

Why it matters

New type of plant soil feedback that reduces conspecific competition and increases interspecific competition.  Seems bad for coexistence, and that it would promote dominance. It also might just be a tradeoff between pathogen defense belowground and allelopathy aboveground.
