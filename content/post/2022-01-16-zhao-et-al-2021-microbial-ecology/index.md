**Seasonal Climate Variations Promote Bacterial alpha-Diversity in Soil**

**Objective:** Test the prediction that seasonal climate variations promote soil bacterial alpha-diversity.

**What they did:** The authors used two global datasets - the global topsoil microbiome and the global soil atlas - that cover a wide geographic range and climatic gradients to test the prediction that seasonal climate variations maintain bacterial diversity in the soil. They examined temperature and precipitation seasonality using the standard deviation (for temperature) or coefficient of variation (for precipitation) as predictors of soil bacterial richness (measured by observed sub-operational taxonomic units). Further, they used a piecewise structural equation model to address the direct and indirect effects of geographic variables, climatic variables, and soil physiochemical properties in determining bacterial alpha-diversity.

**What they found:** Bacterial richness was positively correlated with both temperature and precipitation seasonality.This supports their predictions that variability in temperature and precipitation promote soil bacterial diversity and implies that fluctuation dependent coexistence mechanisms operate in soil bacterial communities. Thus far, much of the work examining biogeographic patterns of soil bacterial diversity considers only the mean annual temperature or precipitation. These analyses suggest that we also need to take into account variability in these climatic predictors. Finally, the authors speculate that the storage effect is the fluctuation dependent mechanism maintaining soil bacterial diversity - but more rigorous testing is needed!
