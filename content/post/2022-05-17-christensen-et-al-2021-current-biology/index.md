Nectar bacteria stimulate pollen germination and bursting to enhance microbial fitness  


What they did:  
They inoculated pollen mixes with 7 different bacterial strains to learn whether bacteria are stimulating premature pollen germination and bursting, and whether they benefit from consuming the burst pollen. 


What they found:  
They found that Acetobacter in nectar benefit from inducing pollen germination and bursting through consuming protoplasm. 4 of the 7 strains of bacteria induced germination and bursting at the 90 minute mark. A. pollinis had higher cell density with pollen than the control, but neither grew in the absense of pollen. They also quantified the amount of protein in solution for burst pollen and found twice as much protein in the solution with microbes. 


Why it matters:  
Pollen is famously difficult to break down for nutrient access, so this study posits a potential microbial mechanism that allows release of pollen nutrients. Changing the chemistry and protein content of nectar through bursting pollen could have implications for plant reproduction and pollinator nutrition. Such changes may impact pollinator attraction which could diminish plant fitness.
