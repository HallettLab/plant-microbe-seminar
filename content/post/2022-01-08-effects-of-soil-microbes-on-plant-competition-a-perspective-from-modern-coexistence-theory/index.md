This paper is a synthesis paper looking at how to incorporate soil microbial effects on plant competition using modern coexistence theory with a major goal being to look at how the effects fall into the two MCT categories of niche differences and fitness differences. 

The paper first briefly reviews previous models and theory on plant-soil microbe interactions, mostly developed by Bever. (The first one is only from 1997!) Next the authors introduce their new model, building off two species Lotka-Voltera models that includes the density of two plant populations and their respective soil microbe populations, looking at how each of these populations affects the others. To explore the different relationships the authors use four different scenarios- Janzen-Connell, enemy release, mutual facilitation, and differential soil conditioning. Additionally they suggest some experimental designs and use data from a 2017 study that is one of the few studies so far that have collected the data necessary to calculate niche and fitness differences related to plant-soil microbe interactions. 

Acknowledging there is such a diversity of relationships and outcomes of soil microbes on plant fitness the authors do not try to make too many generalized statements, just clear frameworks to continue to explore these questions. I really enjoyed the illustrated hypothesis and figures showing experimental design as well as expected results.
