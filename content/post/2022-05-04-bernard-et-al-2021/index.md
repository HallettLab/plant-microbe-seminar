##Plant part and a steep environmental gradient predict plant microbial composition in a tropical watershed
*ByBernard et al. 2021*
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-020-00826-5>

##What they did:
	They examined bacterial and fungal composition across 8 different microhabitats/plant parts on Hibiscus trees along an environmental gradient in a Hawaiian watershed. Their study aimed to characterize the roles of microhabitat and environmental differences explaining variance in microbial composition, which can get at microbial dispersal by inferring the ‘source’ of microbes colonizing different plant parts.

##What they found:
	They found that the communities associated with aboveground plant parts were compositionally nested in the diversity found belowground and in the soil environment, suggesting soil as the major source of aboveground plant-associated microbial communities. They show that fungal communities change more dramatically along environmental gradients than bacteria, and that microhabitat better explained variance in bacterial composition.

##Why it’s interesting/important:
	By analyzing microbial communities associated with so many different plant parts/microhabitats, this study provides a baseline for examining shared microbial taxa and inferring dispersal dynamics in the Hibiscus-associated microbiome. Their analyses are straightforward and clear and I appreciated the writing. You also don’t see a lot of studies like this out of the tropics so that was cool too.
