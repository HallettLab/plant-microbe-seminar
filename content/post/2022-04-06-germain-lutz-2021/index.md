**Shared friends counterbalance shared enemies in old forests**


Germain, S. J., and J. A. Lutz. 2021. Shared friends counterbalance shared enemies in old forests.
Ecology 102(11):e03495. 10.1002/ecy.3495

**Summary:**

+ This study looks at whether plant-soil feedbacks with mycorrhizae mediate negative biotic interactions. They do this by using Bayesian generalized linear models to test the relative contributions of plants and mycorrhizae to various positive and negative interactions within forest communities.They use a spatially explicit dataset from three Forest Dynamics Plots (Utah, Wind River, and Yosemite)to look at woody plant survival in relation to mycorrhizal guilds and forest disturbances.


**Findings:**

+ They found that shared mycorrhizal networks facilitated large tree survival by counterbalancing apparant competition (such as through bark beetles or soil pathogens) as opposed to direct competition.


**Why it's interesting:**

+ Cool finding of mycorrhizae being able to counterbalance apparent competition. Also their large study size was able to reveal interactions that might not be able to be detected in studies conducted with smaller plots.
