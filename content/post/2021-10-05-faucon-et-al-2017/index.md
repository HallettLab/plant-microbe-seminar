This opinion piece dicusses the understanding and theoretical uses of plant functional traits in agroecology. The authors discuss how soil microbe communities can be used to perpetuate ecosystem services in intense agricultural situations by improving soil quality through nutirent dynamics and enhancing biodiversity. These improvements coming directly from plant functional traits, being defined as "morpho-physio-phenological traits, which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction, and survival".

This paper is notable because it discusses some of the fundemental reasons that plant functional traits should be studied more, and how the plant-microbe interface has a multitude of possible desirable prescriptions once humans grasp these concepts.

For a follow-up study, I would test some of the theories mentioned in the piece in my own experiments. I would probably go about taking foliar samples for nutrient levels, and then tracing those nutrients through the plant-microbe community to see the dispersal distance.
