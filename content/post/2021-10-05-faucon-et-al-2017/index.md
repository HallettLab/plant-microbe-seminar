This opinion piece dicusses the understanding and theoretical uses of plant functional traits in agroecology. The authors discuss how soil microbe communities can be used to perpetuate ecosystem services in intense agricultural situations by improving soil quality through nutirent dynamics and enhancing biodiversity. These improvements coming directly from plant functional traits, being defined as "morpho-physio-phenological traits, which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction, and survival".
