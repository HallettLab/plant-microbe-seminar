# What they did and found
This is a review paper about plant-microbe interactions aboveground and belowground with the lens to identify mechanisms for sustainable agriculture that uses less chemical pesticides and fertilizers for farming. 
* They focus on three areas: plant to microbe interactions, root-to-root interactions, and microbe to plant interactions. 
* Microbes can be harmful or beneficial to plants. Pathogenic bacteria inhibit plant growth, while beneficial bacteria allow the promotion of plant growth by making antibiotics to protect plants from pathogens. Moreover, beneficial microbial association with plant roots aid in signaling between plants to resist plant pathogens.

# Importance
The inoculation of seeds and soil with beneficial microbes has a potential to reduce chemical pesticide and fertilizer use, enhance resistance to pathogens, and promote plant growth. This review not only dives into the state of the plant-microbe research but puts it in context of sustainable agriculture.
