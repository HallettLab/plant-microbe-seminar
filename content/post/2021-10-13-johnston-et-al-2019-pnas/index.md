**Summary:**

The authors analyzed changes in the soil microbial community after 4.5 years of experimentally warming permafrost soils by 1.1 degrees Celsius above ambient temperatures. They analyzed the microbial communities at two soil depths: 15-25 cm and 45-55 cm. These depths represent the active layer depth at the beginning and end of the experiment (the active layer is the top of the soil profile in permafrost soils, which thaws out each summer and refreezes over winter . . . below this layer the soil stays frozen all year). They compare the microbial communities at both depths to those in control (unwarmed) plots and relate shifts in community composition (response traits) to changes in soil carbon respiration (effect traits).

The hypotheses tested are:
1. microbial communities at the lower depth will be more sensitive to elevated temperatures

2. shifts in microbial communities will favor traits that promote the release of carbon dioxide and/or methane

3. these effect traits will reflect warming-induced increases in carbon dioxide and methane gas fluxes that have been measured at the field site and throughout the region


**Findings:**

+ They found that the microbial community changed more at the deeper depth, and that this included significant increases in Methanosarcinales (a methanogenic order that is reponsible for transformation of soil carbon into methane gas)

+ These effects correspond to measured increases in methane emissions from warming soils at the research site and throughout the region

**Why it's interesting:**

+ Respiration of soil carbon from thawing permafrost is a significant positive climate feedback that is driven by microbial response & effect traits. However, because field warming experiments are hard to implement (especially in the Arctic), a large part of our knowledge about these processes comes from incubation experiments (where soil samples are collected and warmed in the lab), modelling, or short-term field experiments. This study is unique in that it is a relatively long-term field warming experiment.

+ When permafrost soils thaw and are decomposed by microbes, they typically produce carbon dioxide or methane as a by-product. The environmental factors that shape which gas is produced are important (because methane has a higher greenhouse gas warming potential than carbon dioxide), but can be hard to quantify. This study helps show how warming can change microbial community composition in a way that ends up favoring methane production.
