In Jiang and Moran's 2007 paper, they investigated the impact of different temperature regimes and temperature fluctuations on the coexistence of two protists that compete for bacteria as a food source. The authors found that the two species were not able to coexist at certain fixed temperatures, and one of the species (Paramecium tetraurelia) was not impacted by changing temperature regimes while the other (Colpidium striatum) showed more variable population dynamics when faced with temperature series exhibited positive temporal autocorrelation (what the authors call 'red environments') but less so in environments with little autocorrelation ('white environments'). Typically, these protists were known to have different growth responses to temperature changes and resource utilization patterns, yet this study shows that different temperature regimes and fluctuations (red vs white environments) impact coexistence differently. For example, coexistence in white environments was driven by temperature-dependent competitive effects and resource partitioning, but in red environments, coexistence was driven by resource partitioning and the storage effect, suggesting that temperature can play a large role in determining species coexistence and diversity in a community.
