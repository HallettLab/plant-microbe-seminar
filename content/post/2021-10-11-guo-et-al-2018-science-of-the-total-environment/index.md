What they did:

This study examined microbial communities in wastewater over short-term time periods. They were specifically researching how the microbial communities and functional traits changed with time/flow rate and the origins of these microbes.

What they found:

They found diurnal patterns in microbial diversity (directly related to flow rates). Functional traits also vary with flow, and we see high levels of genes that control methanol oxidation and denitrification. As well, more microbes shared gene sequences with soil than with humans, but a majority of the sequences were unrelated to either.

Importance:

These patterns are important for understanding disease spread, proper wastewater treatment, and improved models of sewage systems. As well, few studies have examined short-term changes and the impacts of flow rate on microbial composition and functional traits.
