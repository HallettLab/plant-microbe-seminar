Soil-borne fungi influence seed germination and mortality, with implications for coexistence of desert winter annual plants. PLoS ONE 14(10):e0224417. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224417

**Summary:**
This study examines the effect of 18 different strains of soil-borne fungi on the germination rates of a coexisting pair of species: Brassica tournefortii (invasive) and Plantago ovata (native). Seeds are inoculated with different strains of fungi and then germinated under differing temperature regimes (mimicking winter and summer germination conditions). The effects of the different fungal strains are analyzed in the context of their implications for promoting or hindering coexistence between the two plant species.

**Findings:**
+ Soil-borne fungi have the potential to alter plant species coexistence.
+ There were different effects of the various fungi on seed germination depending on seasonal temperatures and fungi exhibited both positive and negative effects on germination.
+ Effects on seedling germination and mortality were stronger in summer, but 10 strains influenced germination rates in both temperature regimes.
+ Two strains benefited germination of the native plant more than that of the invasive.

**Why it's interesting:**
+ It's a plant-microbe-coexistence mash-up!
+ Winter annual plants in the Sonoran Desert have been a classic model for studying species coexistence, but this study is the first to look at how soil-borne fungi could alter (either promote or disrupt) coexistence.
