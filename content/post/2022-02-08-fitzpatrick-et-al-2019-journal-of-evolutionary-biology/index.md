## Soil microbes alter plant fitness under competition and drought
https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.uoregon.edu/doi/pdf/10.1111/jeb.13426

This paper examined the impact of soil microbes on plant evolutionary processes (fitness and flowering time). The experiment looked at plant response to competition, microbes, drought, and the interactions. Under intraspecific competition and drought conditions, soil microbes increased plant fitness. Soil microbes also increased the platicity of flowering time and natural selection across different gradients. This strongly indicates that soil microbes can impact plant traits and aid plant fitness under stress.
