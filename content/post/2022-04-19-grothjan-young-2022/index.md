### Bacterial Recruitment to Carnivorous Pitcher Plant Communities: Identifying Sources Influencing Plant Microbiome Composition and Function

What they did: 

This study examined how potential sources of bacteria affect the development of the bacterial community within pitcher plants, how the host plant tissue affects community composition and how established vs. assembling communities differ. In greenhouse experiments, seven replicate pitchers were allocated to five treatments to exclude specific bacterial sources or host tissue. Community composition and functions were examined over 8â€“40 weeks.

What they found: 

They found distinct community composition and functional differences between artificial and real pitchers. There was overlap in composition between milliQ, milliQ + prey, and rainwater + prey treatments suggesting significant recruitment of bacteria from the air. Added insect prey contributes to  commonly found bacteria and provide nutrient resources that influence bacterial assembly. 

Importance:

This study demonstrates that bacterial composition in host pitcher plants is related to both stochastic and specific bacterial recruitment. Host plants influence microbial selection, while water is less significant in community assembly. Microbial functions in the pitchers clearly contribute to macronutrient cycling in the pitcher plant community.
