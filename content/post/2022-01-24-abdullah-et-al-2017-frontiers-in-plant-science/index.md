What they did  
This paper is a review about current knowledge of within-host disease diversity and dynamics of between-pathogen interactions (competition and cooperation) and mechanisms that allow long-term coexistence, drawing upon examples from a range of pathogen co-infections to provide insight into pathogen co-evolution and coexistence. 


What they found  

Why it matters  
Pathogens are one of the greatest threats to plants, and understanding the implications of multiple-pathogen coinfections provides a unique perspective that can inform disease management decisions. Pathogens can behave differently when alone rather than co-infecting the host with another pathogen, so it is particularly important to think about the consequences of co-infection.
