## Plant-mycorrhizal interactions mediate plant community coexistence by altering resource demand

  This paper seeks to incorporate mycorrhizal interactions into plant coexistence frameworks. The authors have created a new model to examine the influence of mycorrhizae (through resource allocation and carbon investment) on plant diversity. They've found that much of plant coexistence is dependent on resource availability and thus, partially dictated by mycorrhizal interactions. At different resource levels, plant diversity could be impeded or promoted. These interactions cause trade-offs in competition through increased resource uptake and scarcity.
