##Soil microbial communities alter conspecific and congeneric competition consistent with patterns of field coexistence in three Trifolium congeners

*By Andrew Siefert, Kenneth W. Zillig, Maren L. Friesen, and Sharon Y. Strauss*

##Goal
Understand how competition and coexistence among conspecific and congeneric plants are affected by soil microbes and whether these interactions lead to positive or negative plant-soil feedbacks. 

##Approach
The authors used three Trifolium species that coexist together on different levels in nature and planted them in a greenhouse using different treatments of different origins of soil microbes and sterilized soil. 

##Importance/Conclusions
Competition among Trifolium species was reduced in soils that were not sterilized and fitness was increased. Overall, these findings suggest that soil microbes facilitate niche differentiation and equalize fitness.
