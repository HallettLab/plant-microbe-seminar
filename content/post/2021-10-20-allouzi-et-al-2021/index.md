##Why is it important
Plastic pollution is a global problem and micro (nano) plastics (MNPs) are becoming increasingly studied in terrestrial systems. Research investigating MNPs in soil is paramount due to their ability to interact with toxic elements (PTEs) in the environment. By-in-large, the effects MNPs have on plant crops and their associated soil systems have been largely overlooked. Consumption of MNPs contaminated plants by humans and animals will eventually leads to detrimental health effects. As such, the identification of MNPs in soil is challenging, making the understanding the ecological consequences of MNPs in terrestrial ecosystems limited. Lastly, there are implications that are more far reaching than just human health – as soil microbes and their associated plant interactions may become more convoluted over time as MNPs accumulate and drive novel effects across the landscape.

##What they did
This is a review article, in which Allouzi et al. investigates MNPs’ fate in the environment and its toxic effects on soil microorganisms, plants and humans along with the interaction of MNPs with PTEs. Additionally, they investigate various analysis methods of MNPs, as well as addressing the critical challenges of future research and MNP management in global trade and production.

##What they found
MNPs can be consumed by bacteria and other microorganisms, which affects their digestive system, reduce reproduction rate, and increases death rate. Likewise, contaminated plants are consumed by animals and MNPs are subsequently found in animal meat and dairy. Humans also consume fruits and vegetables contaminated with MNPs that leads to cancer, digestive problems, and cardiovascular diseases. The assessment, quantification, and identification of MNPs in soil systems is extremely difficult due to inefficient techniques and equipment - as well as isolation from samples, pre-treatment and pre-concentration to in regards to the detection limit. As such, the management of MNPs in the environment can be done through microbial remediation methods, investing in legislation to control the usage of plastics in the global economy, reinforcing waste management education, and increasing the use of biodegradable bioplastics.
