__What they did__: The overwhelming majority of theoretical and empirical work on Janzen-Connel effects have assumed instantaneous and ubiquotuous infection/attack of host species by species-specific enemies. Greenspoon and Wadhawan _modeled Janzen-Connel effects by incorporating more explicit colonization dynamics of enemies_. 

__What they found__: The ability of Janzen-Connell effects to promote species diversity are _lowered when accounting for the spatial dynamics of enemy colonization_. These models demonstrate the potential for Janzen-Connell effects to display delayed density-dependence. 

__Why it's cool__: This is a great example of how theory is used to point us in a different direction! Janzen-Connell effects, as we tend to think about them, _don't generate the same degree of stabilization_ when we add in a more realistic parameter to the models. So what now? Something to discuss.
