Foliar pathogens are unlikely to stabilize coexistence of competing species in a California grassland

https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.2427

What they did

The authors characterized the foliar fungal community in a California grassland community of native and exotive plant species. They evaluated pathogen's host specificity and fitness impacts.

What they found

They found that most of the fungal pathogens were multi-host and had low host specialization. They also found that pathogen damage on plant species and seed production was independent of their relative abundance, suggesting that stabilizing  coexistence mechanisms may be operating at a different spatial scale.

Why it matters

Prevailing hypothesis refer to pathogens as a mechanism to promote plant species coexistance by negative frequence dependence. In the case of this grassland community, multi-host pathogens are decoupling pathogen abundance from density of host species.
