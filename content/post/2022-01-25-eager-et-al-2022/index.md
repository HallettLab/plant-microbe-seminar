## What they did
They sampled microbes along a gradient of AM to EM dominated forests in Indiana. One of the forests had N fertilizer as well. They analyzed fungal communities in each sample and assigned each taxon a functional role (biotrophic plant pathogens, necrotrophic plant pathogens, and ectomycorrhizal fungi). They ignored fungal pathogens of animals and other fungi, and AM fungi due to overall low relative abundances. In addition, they characterized the soil abiotic variables of each forest. 

## What they found
Forests dominated by AM fungi had more saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi. Forest mycorrhizal association explained fungal community composition better than soil abiotic variables. 

## Why it matters
Temperate hardwood forests are changing and becoming more dominated by trees that utilize AM fungal partnerships. This is a first step in figuring out how this change may affect the broader fungal community.
