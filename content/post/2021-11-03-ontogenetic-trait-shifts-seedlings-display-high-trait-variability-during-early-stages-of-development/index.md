# What they did and found
*  Using a manipulative greenhouse experiment, they studied trait variation during early stages of seedling development in seven perennial plant species. They grew the seedlings under low and high water availability.
* They looked at variability in trait values (SLA, root:shoot ratio, specific root length, and root dry matter content) of 20 to 62-day-old seedlings.
* Early seedling trait values shifted greatly during early stages of development and generally differed from average plant trait database values. 
* Overall, observed trait shifts suggested a transition from fast-growing resource acquisitional strategies to more slow-growing conservative strategies over time.

# Importance
* The fact that seedling trait values differed from trait database value indicates that plant trait database values may be poor indicators of seedling trait values. This mismatch could result in inaccurate predictions of community assembly outcomes or community responses to environmental filters during the early stages of recruitment.
