What they did:

They planted 16 agriculturally important crop plants in soils with varying phosphorus levels and measured eight belowground functional traits to test for trade-offs in P acquisition (morphology, chemistry, and mycorrhizal status). They predicted that different crop species would possess different P acquisition traits, and species would not be good at all strategies. 
What they found:

There were high levels of interspecific variation of the measured root traits between the species used in the study. They found a binary based on root thickness: species thin roots exhibited far more branching and less colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and less exudates; while species with thick roots exhibited less branching, higher levels of AMF colonization, and more exudate release. The species showed even greater extremes of this binary in soils with low P. 

Importance:

P is one of the key limiting nutrients for plant growth, especially in agricultural systems. Understanding how P acquisition and belowground traits vary between plant species can help in 1) understanding a part of plant community assembly (the interaction between root traits and nutrient pools / fluxes in soil) and 2) reduce P waste in agroecosystems by selecting crops with appropriate traits. They also demonstrated that when considering a function of interest (i.e., P acquisition) it is essential to choose a suite of traits to measure or a large portion of what is occurring may be missed.
