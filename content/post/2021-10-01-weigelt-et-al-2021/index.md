## Study importance

* Aboveground traits (leaf morphology, leaf nutrients, stem density, plant height) were linked with belowground traits (root morphology, root nutrients, root length, mycorrhizal colonization intensity) for 2510 plant species (see Table 1 for full list of traits).
* Whole-plant trait space had two primary axes: a fast-slow conservation gradient and a root collaboration gradient. 

## Implications
This paper developed a framework for comparing traits across the entire plant. Previously, most studies have focused on either aboveground or belowground traits without integrating them. Future work can expand on this framework by including more plant species, incorporating environmental data, and factoring in phylogenetic relationships. By doing so, we may be better able to predict ecosystem function under different climate change scenarios.

## Visual hypothesis
![A drawing showing a whole plant divided into four axes. The vertical axes is plant height and root height. The first horizontal axis is a conservation gradient with thick leaves and thick roots on one side and thin leaves and thin roots on the other. The second horizontal axis is a collaboration gradient with lots of root hairs on one side and fewer root hairs but longer roots on the other.](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e4993945-3ea1-4968-acd8-b4eb60756348/nph17590-fig-0001-m.jpg)
*Figure 1 from Weigelt et al. 2021. The integrated framework of plant form and function based on knowledge and expectations from separate findings of the leaf economics spectrum (LES), the root economics space (RES) and the spectrum of whole-plant form and function. We hypothesize a strong coordination of leaf and root conservation gradients representing a gradient of species from fast resource return on investment to slow resource return on investment both above and below ground. Further we expect an orthogonal collaboration gradient of root traits representing a gradient of species from ‘do it yourself’ resource uptake strategies to strategies where resource acquisition is outsourced to collaborative fungal partners. We do not necessarily expect a single gradient of plant size for maximum height and rooting depth. Figure courtesy of Nathan Armistead, ORNL Graphics, based on Kramer-Walter et al. (2016).*
