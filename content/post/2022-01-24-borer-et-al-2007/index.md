California grasslands have become highly invaded, with exotic annual grasses displacing native perennial grasses. Recent work has found the annual grasses to be worse competitors but still becoming dominant. The authors propose disease as a mechanism for annual grass invasion in this system. 

To explore this hypothesis, the authors paramaterize a model with two grasses commonly occurring in CA grasslands, one a native perennial and one an exotic annual, as well as the aphid spread barley yellow dwarf virus. Using the empirical parameters the community dynamics are modeled out 100 years.

Based on the paramaterized model, the authors conclude that in a disease free environment the perennials would persist and be able resist invasion. However, they find that with the pathogen present, perennials are more negatively effected and so despite being the better competitor the annual grasses can invade. Although the pathogen previously existed in the system and affected perennial grasses, the introduction of annual exotic grasses has shifted the impact the pathogen has on the perennial grasses. 

Why this paper is cool: Most papers combining invasion and pathogens either focus on enemy-release hypotheses or novel-weapons hypotheses whereas this study looks at how a previous relationship between plant host and pathogen gets disrupted for the benefit of the invader.  Cool how introduction of a new species shifts the relationship between two other species that previously had a more harmonious relationship!
