Facilitation of phosphorous uptake in maize plants in mycorrhizosphere bacteria

Battini et al. 2017, Scientific Reports 

What they did

Phosphorous is a plant nutrient that contributes to plant growth, structure, and is an important driver of increased agricultural yield. The authors were interested in the degree to which arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and their associated bacterial symbionts facilitate plant acquisition of phosphorous. To test this question, they performed an experiment on maize with treatments containing AMF, AMF + bacterial symbionts, and no AMF or bacteria. Among each treatment, they measured root length, plant growth, and phosphorous uptake.

 

What they found

Plant phosphorous uptake and growth was facilitated significantly with the presence of AMF, and even more so in treatments with AMF + bacterial symbionts. They also found that in treatments with AMF + bacterial symbionts, the microbiota interacting with AMF promoted the development of extraradical mycelia.

 

Why itâ€™s important

These results provide insights into potential practices of enhancing/maximizing agricultural yield, as current yield falls far below the expected food demand in the coming decades. Effective management of AMF and symbiotic microbiota can potentially address this issue.
