Xi et al. look at the relationships between 6 plant functional traits and plant-soil feedbacks. Particularly they asked how the relationship may differ if looking at individual plant-soil feedbacks or pairwise plant-soil feedbacks. They highlight how soil microbes are part of plant soil feedbacks but do not differentiate the different aspects of plant-soil feedbacks throughout the paper as much as I would have thought. 
To investigate these relationships the authors do a meta-analysis. Important values calculate were if PSFs were positive or negative, based on the log response ratio which compares how a plant grows in one soil versus another. The six functional traits looked at are specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, specific root length, plant height, seed mass, and fine root dimension. 
The data supported the first hypothesis that individual PSF is negatively correlated with fast life-history traits but the second hypothesis that pairwise PSF is correlated with trait dissimilarity was only supported when looking at specific root length, fine root dimension and height. 
The authors discuss in length how these results play into how PSF drive plant coexistence. For example plants with fast-life history traits that may be dominant in many way are balanced out by negative relationships with PSF. 
From their results the authors state they are now able to make predictions about how PSF may vary across environmental gradients. This study is also important because it united two previously separate areas of research- PSF and functional traits, highlighting a reciprocal relationship of plant traits and soil effects.
