# Plant-microbe mashup!

## _BI 607 with Krista and Lauren_

Welcome to our new journal club! Our goal for this journal club is to review classic and recent literature at the interface of plant and microbial ecology. 

**Our game plan:** We will start the seminar by identifying broad themes of interest. We then will spend several weeks with each theme. At the beginning of each new theme we will discuss a classic article on the subject. During this week each of you will find a cool newer paper on the theme and post a brief blog post about what the paper did and found, and why you think it's notable. As a class we'll vote on what we want to read next from among the papers summarized. By the end of this we will have discussed some sweet old and new papers as a group, and will have a developed a communal annotated bibliography of hot papers at the interface of plant and microbial ecology. Woot!

**Themes:** TBD first day of class
